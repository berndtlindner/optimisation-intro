# Optimisation introduction
Crash course introduction to the field of optimisation and related fields.

# Background
A few colleagues were interested in furhter knowledge of optimisation (objective functions, constraints, etc.) and metaheurstics such as genetic algorithms.

# Outline
Plan to use basic intor/theory slides with some examples/tutorials in R/python pakcages, so far, for the following sections: 
- Predictive vs prescriptive analytics and how optimisation and machine learning fits into them
- Linear and non-linear formulations of single-objective optimisation problems and mathematical programming techniques (linear programming, etc.) to solve them. 
- Explosion of combinatorial optimisation
- Metaheuristics
- Multi-objective optimisation
