# Optimisation introduction
Crash course introduction to the field of optimisation and related fields.

# Background
A few colleagues were interested in further knowledge of optimisation (objective functions, constraints, etc.) and metaheurstics such as genetic algorithms.

# Content
Currently all the the code, text, etc. is in one "presentation" notebook [optimisation_intro.ipynb](optimisation_intro.ipynb)
